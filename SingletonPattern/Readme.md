## Singleton Design Pattern

* Belongs to Creational Pattern
* Deals with Instance creation
* Ensure only one Instance is created for a class in the application

### Implementation 
* Declare all the constructor method in the class as private
* Private static property that holds Instance of the class
* Static method that returns created Instance 
* Make the class as sealed class
